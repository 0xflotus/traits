* REMOVE ALL DEPENDENCIES THIS PACKAGE HAS ON OTHER ETS PROJECTS!

* Refactor util/equivalence.py to remove the dependency on Traits, or else move
    the module out of this project.

* Separate the logger plugin (basically everything from enthought.logger.plugin
    on down) from the core logger utility methods / classes this package
    contains.   This will remove some dependencies in our extras.

* Refactor util/traits/editor/parameter_choice_editor.py to be toolkit
    independent -- it is currently hardwired for wx.  Or move it out of this
    project.
